<p class="fs-5 mb-4">                         
If  you want to send encrypted messages to your friends.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Or you want to send encrypted emails to your boss or colleague at work.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Then today we will talk about how you can   encrypt your messages.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
You use a password to login to your facebook or gmail right?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If you use a wrong password gmail will not allow you to login…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
But when you use the right password you will login into your account and start reading your emails or sending messages on facebook.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So it is very simple equation:
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If you use the right password then you will log into your account.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If you use a wrong password then you will not log into your account.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you want to send an encrypted message you will also use a password to protect your message.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If someone has the right password he can read the original message but if he has a wrong password he can not read the original message.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Let’s take a real life example:
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
You want to encrypt a message to your closest friend. You encrypt it by using a password and then you will send the encrypted message to your friend.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When he gets your encrypted message, if he has the right password he can read your message but if he does not have the password he can not read your message.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So before you send him an encrypted message you should first give him the right password that you will use to encrypt and decrypt messages.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And when he wants to send you an encrypted message he will also use the same password to encrypt his message and you will use it to decrypt it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Both of you use the same password to encrypt and decrypt the messages.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
In cryptography when we use the same password to encrypt and decrypt messages this type of cryptography we call it symmetric cryptography.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So symmetric cryptography uses the same password to encrypt and decrypt the messages.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Before you and your friend start sending encrypted messages both of you should choose a password that will be used by both of you.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Before you and your friend start sending and receiving encrypted messages
You should have the same password that you will use to encrypt and decrypt messages.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">


But in cryptography this  shared secret password is called a secret key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So the password used to encrypt and decrypt a message its name is key.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
I used the word password just to make it easier to explain and understand.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So from now we will call it a key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So let's dive into more details:








</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

First, what is a key?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
It is Secret value like a password used to encrypt and decrypt messages.</br>
In symmetric encryption, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.</br>
 The sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.</br>
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
For this reason The key must be kept secret and only the sender and the receiver know it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

For example you want to send a message to your friend by using symmetric encryption.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So you and your friend need to have the same key to be able to exchange encrypted messages.
</p>
<h2>
Types of symmetric encryption algorithms:
</h2>
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
There are two types of symmetric encryption algorithm
First is stream cipher and the second is block cipher.
</p>

<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
Stream cipher:
</h3>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
This type of ciphers encrypt plaintext data one bit at a time.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
In  This type of ciphers the encryption process happens bit by bit and the data gets processed in a stream.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
This type of ciphers are fast and do not take a lot of resources.
</p>
<h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
Block cipher:
</h3 >
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
First the plaintext breaks down into fixed-length groups of bits we call blocks.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And then each block gets encrypted as a unit.
</p>
