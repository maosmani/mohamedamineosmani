 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Hackers can intercept your emails when you send them over the internet because they can listen to the communications that happen over the network.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Also, they can hack your email account, or even worse they can hack your email server.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
If someone hacks your email account he can read all your emails.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Or if he hacked your email server he can read all your emails too.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 
Companies and people use email every day for their most important communication.
 
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
In 2020 people have sent over 306.4 billion emails each day.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Companies use it as their primary way of communication, they send their most important documents by email.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So how can you protect your emails from hackers?
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
You can encrypt your emails before sending them so only you and the recipient can read them.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you send an encrypted email, if a hacker intercepts it he can not read it.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What if he hacks your email account?
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
He can not read them too because he will find only the encrypted version of your emails.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What if a hacker breaks into your email server?
He can not read your emails either.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you send encrypted emails no one can read them, there are only two who can read them: you and the recipient.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
This type of encryption is called end-to-end encryption.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
End-to-end encryption means that only you and the recipient can read the email.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you use end-to-end encryption you encrypt the email and the recipient decrypts it.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If a hacker gets the encrypted email he can not decrypt it.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Even if he tries to decrypt it will take him years and years and a powerful server or even supercomputer to do it.
</p>


 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">How does end-to-end encryption work?</h2>

 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

end-to-end encryption uses public keys to encrypt the email.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The sender encrypts messages using the recipient’s public key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 The recipient decrypts the message using his private key.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If you want to send an encrypted email to your friend you first need to get its public key because you will use it to encrypt the email and then send it.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When your friend gets your encrypted email he will use his private key to decrypt it and then read it.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
There are two methods for implementing end-to-end encryption for encrypting email.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The first is PGP and the second S/MIME. 
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
You can use PGP and other applications like it if you want to start using encrypted emails.
</p>



  <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">What is PGP?</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

PGP is software used for encrypting and decrypting emails.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 It was invented in 1991.
  </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
It uses both public-key cryptography and symmetric cryptography.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
But PGP isn't a free application to use. You must buy it first if you want to use it.
 </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
But there is other free software that you can use to encrypt your emails.
 </p>



 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">What is GNU Privacy Guard?</h2>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">

It is software used to encrypt and decrypt emails, you can use it for free, unlike PGP.
