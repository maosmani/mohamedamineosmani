<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Your first line of defense against cybercriminals is your passwords.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So why passwords…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Because if they get your passwords...then they can get into your accounts and to everything they want to...
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If someone gets your Facebook password then he can log in to your Facebook account and read your important messages with your friends and family…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And he can know a lot of secrets about your life…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
He can know everything important about you because you told your friends about them…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And maybe he can use this information against you…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What if a hacker gets the passwords that you use at work then he can log in to your work accounts like your professional email...LinkedIn...zoom...zapier.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
He can read a lot of information about the company that you work for and this informations could put the company at a big risk and maybe they will hack their most important assents…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
As you can see when a hacker gets you passwords he can do a lot of bad things to you...to your company...to your family…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So you need to take care of your passwords because if someone gets them you will be in a bad position…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Now we are going to talk about a few tips that you will need to keep in your mind about passwords…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
First, you need to make your password strong as much as possible…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
But how you can do it?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you set a new password or change your existing passwords make sure to make your password very long...make sure your password is more than 12 characters long...
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Also, make sure that you use in your passwords numbers...upper case characters...lower case characters...special characters…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So a strong password is a mix of upper and lower case characters with special characters and contains numbers and it must be longer than 12 characters…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Never use the same password twice.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Some people use the same password in more than one site or application…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
It’s a bad thing to do because if a hacker is targeting you then if he gets your password Then he will try to use the same password on a different site…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What if he gets your Facebook password...and you are using the same password for your bank account…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What you happen if he has your bank account?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Just imagine it’s a hard thing to imagine…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So never use the same password on two different sites…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Never give your passwords to someone else:
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
This is because if you give your password to someone else who knows what could happen if he did not take care of your password…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Maybe someone else will find it and hack you…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Maybe he will forget your account password in a place at the park and a hacker finds it…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So when it comes to your password never give them to someone else never trust anyone about your passwords…
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So your password is very important never give them to someone else...never reuse the same password twice...make sure your passwords are longer than 12 characters...
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When you create a new password or change your existing password use them numbers...special character...upper and lower case characters.
</p>
