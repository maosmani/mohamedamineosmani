Sending your sensitive information through the internet is always a big risk.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

If you send your sensitive information through the internet using email or social media applications like facebook  or whatsapp it is always a big risk.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

But why is it a big risk?
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Because hackers can break into your accounts and see your most important information and most important documents that you have sent in the past and now.
 
 </p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
What if a hacker gets your  bank details that you have sent to your wife?
 </p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Or someone else sees that you will be on vacation outside the country then he can steal your house.
Or he can know that you will be on a vacation outside the country in the next month. 
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
He can steal your house because he knows when no one will be in the home.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

But there is a solution for all  this problem.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 You can encrypt your emails before sending them so if someone hacks your email account  he can’t read  your email because they are encrypted.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
You can use tools like PGP or GPG to encrypt your emails before sending them.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
PGP was created back in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann, but it is not free software.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
For this reason the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) created openPGP and it is an email encryption standard that is implemented by multiple software .
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So openPGP is like a free version of PGP.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
OpenPGP was originally derived from the PGP software.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
There is also  GPG, a free and open source software tool that implements openPGP standard and it is used to encrypt emails too.
</p>
 
 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">How does PGP actually work?</h2>

 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 PGP uses public key encryption so if you want to send an encrypted email by using PGP then the first step is to get the public key of the recipient.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
The second step  is to encrypt your message by using the recipient's public key.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
And then you will send the encrypted email to the recipient.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
When the recipient gets the email he will use his public key to decrypt your message.
</p>
 

 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">What's the Difference Between PGP, OpenPGP, and GnuPG?</h2>
  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
So  what is the Difference?
</p>
 <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">PGP: </h3>
   <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Created by  Phil Zimmerman in 1991,  and it is not free software.
</p>
 <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">OpenPGP: </h3>
    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">


 The OpenPGP created by   the Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT). 
</p>

 <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">GnuPG: </h3>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

 It is a free software that you can use for free unlike PGP and  is an implementation of the OpenPGP standard.

 </p>
 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">How To Use PGP Encryption.</h2>

 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">

If you want to use PGP then you will need to create your own PGP keys and then you will secure your PGP keys by using passphrase.
</p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
 
When you create your keys you will need to share your public key so if someone wants to send you an encrypted email he can find your public key.
 </p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
If your public keys are created and you have shared your public key then now you can start sending and receiving encrypted emails.
 </p>
 <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
Now you can Read your messages.
