<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

Email is the number one communication tool. businesses and professionals use it every day.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

Hackers always target emails. because if they can hack your email. they will get access to all your accounts like your bank account, social media, and your accounts at work.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
When you send an email hackers can intercept it on the internet, even worse they can read it. 

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
For this reason. you should always send encrypted emails to protect yourself from them.

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
So what is email encryption? And why you should encrypt your emails?. 

</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
In this blog post, we will answer those questions, more.

<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
So if you’re ready to go all in with email encryption, this post is for you.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

Let’s dive right in.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
Hackers can intercept your emails when you send them over the internet, because they can listen to the communications that happen over the network.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
If someone hacks your email account he can read all your emails. which means he will know a lot of information about you. and your companies, and then he can use it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
Companies use email as their primary way of communication. they send their most important documents by email.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
In 2020 people have sent over 306.4 billion emails each day.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
So how to protect your emails from hackers?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
Email encryption allows you to protect yourself from hackers. you can encrypt your emails before sending them, so only you and the recipient can read them.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
When you send an encrypted email, if a hacker intercepts it he can’t read it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
What if he hacks your email account?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
He can’t read them too, because he will find only the encrypted version of your emails.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
What if a hacker breaks into your email server? He can’t read your emails either.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
When you send encrypted emails no one can read them, there are only two who can read them: you and the recipient.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 
This type of encryption is called end-to-end encryption.
</p>


 <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">End-to-end encryption:</h2>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

End-to-end encryption means that only you and the recipient can read the email. when you use it, you encrypt the email and the recipient decrypts it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

If a hacker gets the encrypted email he can not decrypt it. even if he tries to decrypt it will take him years and years, and a powerful server or even supercomputer to do it.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">How does end-to-end encryption work?</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

It uses public keys to encrypt the email. the sender encrypts messages using the recipient’s public key. the recipient decrypts the message using his private key.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

If you want to send an encrypted email to your friend. first need to get its public key, because you will use it to encrypt the email, and then send it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

When your friend gets your encrypted email, he will use his private key to decrypt it, and then read it.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

There are two methods for implementing end-to-end encryption. the first is PGP and the second S/MIME.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4"> 

You can use PGP, and similar applications, if you want to send encrypted emails.
 </p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
 What is PGP?
</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
PGP is software used for encrypting and decrypting emails. it was invented in 1991. it uses both public-key cryptography and symmetric cryptography.
</p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
PGP isn't free software to use, but there is other free software that you can use to encrypt your emails like GPG.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-5">
What is GNU Privacy Guard?
</h2>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
It is software used to encrypt and decrypt emails, you can use it for free because it’s open source software.
